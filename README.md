GVG110 Control Panel Testing

Notes and scripts that I've used for GVG110 Control panel computer interfacing and testing.

I've modified my control panel mostly based upon <http://www.lefflerpost.com.au/ATEM/gvg110%20panel%20mods.pdf>

I've connected an arduino and installed code on it from <https://github.com/lebaston100/GVG110panelMod/>

My control panel has known issues with the T-bar and with just this configuration described above, in testing, I intermittently receive key details on the websocket server (websockettest.py) but regularly received the key press / unpress commands without key details.  I will be investigating further.
